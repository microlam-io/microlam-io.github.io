      <h3>Simplicity, hackability and efficiency</h3>
      <p>Starting with Microlam is very simple, as you can deploy our sample application to AWS in 5 minutes, but it is never done magically, but always in a way you can hack and understand fully. Development life-cyle is kept as short of possible and there is no compromise on production performance.</p>

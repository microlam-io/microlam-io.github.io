Learn how to create a Hello World Microlam app.
This guide covers:

* Bootstrapping an application
* Testing the application
* Packaging of the application
* Deploying to AWS

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* from 15 minutes to 1 hour
* an IDE
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}
* https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[AWS CLI]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html[AWS CDK CLI]

[TIP]
.Verify Maven is using the Java you expect
====
If you have multiple JDK's installed it is not certain Maven will pick up the expected java
and you could end up with unexpected results.
You can verify which JDK Maven uses by running `mvn --version`. 
====

Microlam is running `docker` using the `exec-maven-plugin` and the `maven-toolchains-plugin`.
You need to configure your paths (so docker command can be found) in the `toolchains.xml` file in `~/.m2/toolchains.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>
<toolchains>
    <toolchain>
        <type>paths</type>
        <provides>
            <id>binaries</id>
        </provides>
        <configuration>
            <!-- Defines the folders to search for binaries of the "paths" toolset -->
            <paths>
                <path>/usr/local/bin</path>
            </paths>
        </configuration>
    </toolchain>
</toolchains>
----


== Architecture

In this guide, we create a straightforward application serving 2 endpoints `mult` and `sum` with a REST API:

* `POST /mult`
* `POST /sum`

image::quickstart-architecture.drawio.png[alt=Architecture, align=center]

The 2 endpoints are connected to the same lambda via Proxy integration.

Both receive a json body of the form:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
"arguments" : [ 2, 4, 6]
}
----

The expected response will be a json of the form:

[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
{
"result" : 12
}
----

The result will be the sum or the product of the arguments depending on the respective endpoints `/sum` or `/mult`.



== Bootstrapping the project

The easiest way to create a new Microlam project is to open a terminal and run the following command:

In your CLI:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=io.microlam -DarchetypeArtifactId=microlam-lambda-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion={microlam-lambda-quickstart-version}
----

You will have to answer a few questions:

* Choose a `groupId`, `artifactId`, `version` and `package` for your new project
* Choose your `awsBucket` : this is the name of an S3 bucket where the lambda artifacts will be deployed
* Choose your `awsProfile` : this is the name of your AWS profile
* Choose your `awsRegion`: this is the name of an AWS region (ex: `eu-west-1`)
* Choose your `lambdaName`: this is the name of your Lambda must be also suitable as the name of the Java class for the Lambda.

[TIP]
.In case you provided incorrect values for `awsBucket`, `awsProfile` or `awsRegion`, no problem!
====
It is very easy to set these values afterwards:
Change the file `[package].devops.Aws` in `src/test/java` and eventually also `samconfig.toml` if you need to deploy with AWS SAM
====

== Discovering and working with the generated project

=== The Java code in src/main/java

Let't take a concrete example:

* `groupId` = `tech.solusoft`
* `artifactId` = `microlam-lambda`
* `version` = `1.0-SNAPSHOT`
* `package` = `tech.solusoft.example`
* `awsProfile` = `premiumpay`
* `awsRegion` = `eu-west-1`
* `lambdaName` = `MicrolamLambda`

Once generated, import the project into your prefered IDE, this is what you will find in `src/main/java`:

image::quickstart-files-src-main.png[alt=Files in src/main/java, align=left]

* In the `[package].bs` folder, you can find the business services (separating the business operations from the AWS code is a good thing).
* In the `[package].lambda` folder you can see 3 classes providing the Lambda entry points, in fact, only one (here `MicrolamLambda`) will be deployed to AWS (One good reason for that is to ensure this lambda will be more hot). `MultLambda` and `SumLambda` are really doing the work.
* In the `[package].body` folder you can see `LambdaBodyIn` and `LambdaBodyOut`, they are POJO representing what expect the lambda as Input and what to expect from its output.

Let's see the code for one of our Lambda (MultLambda):

image::quickstart-mult-lambda-code.png[alt=MultLambda code, align=left]

You can see the `MultLambda` code is very simple (as `SumLambda`), using the business service as a singleton (line 16), implementing the interface `APIGatewayProxyLambda` only method `handleRequest`.
Note the use of the library https://johnzon.apache.org/[Apache Johnzon] with Jsonb and Jsonp to convert from/to json to/from our POJOs (lines 21 and 26).

As we said, we use `MicrolamLambda` as a proxy to redirect the call to `MultLambda` and `SumLambda` depending on the target resource `/mult` or `/sum`:

image::quickstart-microlambda-code.png[alt=MicrolamLambda code, align=left]

As you can see, `MicrolamLambda` implements the `registerAllLambda()` method from its abstract mother class and map each endpoint to a given lambda (it may be the same), the mapping is:

[source,java,subs=attributes+]
----
[METHOD][SPACE][RESOURCE] -> Lambda
----

Where:

* [METHOD] is `POST` or `GET` or `PUT` etc... (the Http Method)
* [SPACE] is the space character
* [RESOURCE] is the resource for AWS, or endpoint (here `/mult` or `/sum`)

[TIP]
.Solving the aggregated log problem
====
As only the `MicrolamLambda` is deployed to AWS, the logs from `MultLambda` and `SumLambda` will be available in Cloudwatch at the same place inside `MicrolamLambda` logs. The `MicrolamLambda` mother class is logging at the beginning in which Lambda it is redirecting.
Be careful to always map any new Lambda, but even if you forgot to map it, the logs will tell you exactly which mapping was not found.
====

=== The pom.xml

You will find the import of the Microlam BOM, allowing you to omit the version on the different Microlam dependencies, but that's not the main point.

What is original is that, you will not find any `microlam-maven-plugin` that will hide all the work that is made magically to compile or configure your native compilation.

One of Microlam value is to be easily hackable, because on a simple example, the magical solution may work, but what happens when it does not ? Microlam is designed with the idea that your project is enough complex to not work with a magical solution. 
In fact, this Quickstart project will not compile magically because of the usage of Gson (using reflection) to Map from/to json to/from the POJOs for example... So Microlam will help you generate the configuration for the compilation. 

Microlam is providing everything inside this pom.xml, helping you compile, generate the Java Deployment package for your Lambdas and also help you compile natively your project with https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] https://www.graalvm.org/21.3/reference-manual/native-image/[Native Image].
In order to offer an uniform development experience (for linux, MacOS or Windows developer), Microlam is using Docker for compiling natively and building the Lambda Custom deployment package containing your compiled code.

The pom.xml allow you to achieve different goals:

==== Generating the Lambda Java Deployment package

Use simply the java maven profile:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn package
----

This command build the Lambda Java deployment package in `target/` folder with the name `[xxx]-aws-lambda.jar`.

[TIP]
.Profile -Pjava
====
Generating the Lambda Java deployment package is coming from the profile `-Pjava` which is now activated by default. You may disable it with `-P-java`.
====

[TIP]
.Which Java version to choose ?
====
Currently AWS supports only `Java 8` or `Java 11` Runtimes, but it is possible to use a Custom Runtime to deploy also for `Java 17` or `Java 19`. Microlam is providing the maven argument `-Djava17layer=axx64` or `-Djava19layer=axx64` for bringing the layer, see next TIP for detailed instructions and this project (https://github.com/microlam-io/lambda-java17-layer)[AWS Lambda Java 17 Runtime] or this one (https://github.com/microlam-io/lambda-java19-layer)[AWS Lambda Java 19 Runtime].
By default, Microlam is configured by default to use `Java 11`, but you can change this to `Java 17` or `Java 19` by setting the property `release.version` to 17 or 19.
====

[TIP]
.How to use Java 17 or Java 19?
====
First modify the pom.xml property: `release.version` to 17 or 19.
Then use the command `mvn package -Djava17layer=axx64` (or `-Djava19layer=axx64`) where `axx64` is `amd64` or `arm64`. This brings the java 17/19 layer in your `target/` folder.
You need to deploy the Java 17/19 Layer and the simplest way is to use the CDK (but using the AWS console is also possible), see and update as necessary the Class `[xxx].devops.cdk.CreateApp` (from `src/test` folder).
====


[TIP]
.Why we need the Java Lambda if we can compile to native ?
====
It is important to reduce the developement cycle develop-test-develop as much as possible. It may be a good idea to develop and test your Java Lambda because it is very fast and to compile only when needed. This is the same code, so it should be ok.
====

==== Configure, Compile and Generate the Native Lambda Deployment Package

For an introduction to the subject of Native compilation for Java, you can refer to this https://frank-afriat.medium.com/lets-compile-your-aws-lambda-in-java-eafc24aae269[article].

The native build is depending on the java version (`java11`, `java17` or `java19`) and the target architecture (`amd64` or `arm64`).

You need to provide this information in the maven command line using `-Dnative=javaXX-axx64` (by replacing XX and xx with the correct values).

Let's say your target is `java11-amd64`, if everything is ready, you just have to use this maven command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn package -Dnative=java11-amd64 -Pcompile
----

In case the build is successful, the Native deployment package is in the `target` folder with the name `[xxx]-aws-lambda-native.zip`.

But generally, this build will not work immediately and if it works, the resulting compiled code will not work at runtime. Actually, the GraalVM native-image tool is compiling only the code that is necessary using a static analysis, 
which is not covering the cases of usage of Java Reflection for example, in our case, our use of Gson... that's why we need to provide an additional configuration to the tool.

The solution proposed by Microlam is to generate this configuration automatically by the https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Agent/[GraalVM Tracing Agent] while you are running your integration tests on it.

This can be done by this maven command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn package -Dnative=java11-amd64 -Pconfig
----

At the end of the build, a container is running, letting you run your tests on it :

In our case, you can run the Junit Tests in the class in `[xxx].devops.LocalLambdaTests`.

The generated configuration is updated (and merged) every 30s in the folder: `target/[artifactId]-[version]-native-config/java11-amd64/function/config/`.

You can manually copy the files to the folder `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/[groupId]/[artifactId]/`.

Then it is a good idea, to compile again the Native lambda which can be done with this command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn package -Dnative=java11-amd64 -Pcompile
----

This will copy the Native deployment package to the `target` folder with the name `[xxx]-aws-lambda-native.zip`.

Then test locally the result of your compilation:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn package -Dnative=java11-amd64 -Prun
----

At the end of the build, a container is running, letting you try your native lambda locally.

In our case, you can run again the Junit Tests in the class in `[xxx].devops.LocalLambdaTests`.

If everything is working as expected, you are ready to generate your deployment package.

=== The Native configuration

It is found in the `src/main/resources` folder:

image::quickstart-files-native-config.png[alt=Files in src/main/java, align=left]

See how to generate this configuration using the `config` profile.

=== The Java code in src/test/java

This is what you will find in `src/test/java`:

image::quickstart-files-src-test.png[alt=Files in src/main/java, align=left]

* In the `[package].devops` folder, you can find code to help you test and deploy your Lambda.
* In the `[package].devops.cdk` folder, you can find the class `CreateApp` including all what is necessary to deploy the complete Application to AWS using AWS CDK.
* In the `[package]` folder, you can find the Class LambdaTest, which show you how to test your Lambda code without testing the Lambda Machinery for Unit testing.

=== Deploying your Application with the CDK

[TIP]
.Bootstrapping your project for the CDK
====
You need to bootstrap your project before using the CDK only the first time.
For this, inside the project root folder, use the command: `cdk bootstrap` 
====

Using the AWS CDK is the recommended way to deploy your App and to maintain it during development.

As you develop, modify `CreateApp` if necessary, for our example, you need to apply a few changes to set the function Runtime, Architecture and Code according to your needs, because by default it deploys the Java Lambda Package.

Then use this command to deploy or synchronize your deployment:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
cdk deploy
----

The `Aws` class is used for holding the Aws configuration used by the `CreateApp` class for the CDK deployment.
When you develop your lambdas, it is possible to run simply the unit test in `UploadAndUpdateLambda` to upload your java deployment or `UploadAndUpdateLambdaNative` to upload your native deployment.

In case you want to clean everything on your aws account, you just need to run:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
cdk destroy
----

== Logging

By default, the project is using https://github.com/microlam-io/slf4j-simple-lambda[slf4j-simple-lambda] which is a fork of `slf4j-simple` dedicated to AWS Lambda with these features:

* Support for AWSRequestId
* Allow env properties with underscore instead of point to be compatible with the AWS lambda env property naming rules

You can change the configuration by updating the file  `simplelogger.properties`.

All the logs will be found in `CloudWatch` as usual.

For understanding how `slf4j-simple-lambda` solves the Java Aws Lambda Logging problem you can refer to this https://frank-afriat.medium.com/solving-the-java-aws-lambda-logging-problem-305b06df457f[article].
